Seems to me, every day should be Earth Day.	M
Okay to not know. But when you don't know, yet think you know, and wield power in that ignorance, it's a recipe for disaster.	M

.@GeorgeTakei  My bad.  You\u2019re only 78. An Error in the Captain\u2019s Log. I\u2019ll get that fixed right away.	M
Hey @GeorgeTakei, you turn 79 today but you look 59. Have you secretly mastered time dilation in Einstein\u2019s Relativity?	M
Hey @GeorgeTakei, FYI: Your 79 orbits around the Sun, if traversed at Warp Factor 1, would take 7 days, 10 hours &amp; 12 minutes	M
Hey @GeorgeTakei, you were born 119.5 billion Earth-orbit miles ago, in 1937. But you don\u2019t look a day older than 90 billion.	M
Hey @GeorgeTakei, I hear today is your birthday. Captain's Log says you\u2019ve been around the Sun 79 times.  Congratulations!	M
