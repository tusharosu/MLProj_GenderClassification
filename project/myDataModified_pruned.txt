The future is in the hands of those who belong to the 21st century with the opportunity to build a better humanity by training the mind.	M
Friends are made on the basis of trust and trust only grows if you are kind to people.	M
It is important to teach young people at school that violence is a fruitless approach to solving problems.	M
It\u2019s clear that the ultimate source of happiness is warm-heartedness.	M
Anger cannot coexist with inner peace, which is the principal characteristic of happiness.	M
When our mind is calm, we\u2019re better able to find peace of mind and live a joyful life.	M
If we have respect and concern for other beings, we\u2019ll be able to create an atmosphere of happiness, harmony and real brotherhood	M
One of our best human qualities is intelligence; it enables us to judge what is beneficial and what brings harm.	M
In our daily lives, mindfulness, a more holistic and compassionate attitude helps us keep our peace of mind; it\u2019s good for our health too.	M
Compassion is not just the business of the religious; it is important to know it\u2019s everyone\u2019s business, it is a question of human survival.	M
We need to strike a balance between material and spiritual progress, a balance achieved on the basis of love and compassion.	M
Only tolerance and patience can protect us from the destructive effects of anger and hatred.	M
Everyone can practise non-violence, it only calls for determination. If you succeed, it will open the way to a far more peaceful world.	M
Affection and compassion are indispensable in daily life.	M
Idealistic as it may sound, altruism should be the driving force in business, not just competition and a desire for wealth.	M
True compassion isn\u2019t just an emotional response, it\u2019s a firm commitment founded on reason, which doesn\u2019t change if others behave badly.	M
Determination, courage, self-confidence lead to success, but we should always remain humble, modest and unpretentious.	M
Showing respect for others\u2019 rights and views is not only the source of reconciliation it\u2019s also an aspect of compassion.	M
Tolerance is always important, it helps us overcome difficulties. Without it, small things irritate us and we overreact.	M
Material development only gives us sensory pleasure, but to be lastingly happy we need to develop our minds. We need calm minds.	M
