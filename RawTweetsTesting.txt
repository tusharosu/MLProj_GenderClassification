One of our best human qualities is intelligence; it enables us to judge what is beneficial and what brings harm.	M
In our daily lives, mindfulness, a more holistic and compassionate attitude helps us keep our peace of mind; it\u2019s good for our health too.	M
Compassion is not just the business of the religious; it is important to know it\u2019s everyone\u2019s business, it is a question of human survival.	M
We need to strike a balance between material and spiritual progress, a balance achieved on the basis of love and compassion.	M
Only tolerance and patience can protect us from the destructive effects of anger and hatred.	M
Everyone can practise non-violence, it only calls for determination. If you succeed, it will open the way to a far more peaceful world.	M
Affection and compassion are indispensable in daily life.	M
Idealistic as it may sound, altruism should be the driving force in business, not just competition and a desire for wealth.	M
True compassion isn\u2019t just an emotional response, it\u2019s a firm commitment founded on reason, which doesn\u2019t change if others behave badly.	M
Determination, courage, self-confidence lead to success, but we should always remain humble, modest and unpretentious.	M

This is the most exciting atrociously played 4th quarter I've ever seen.	M
I can tell my grandkids that I went to the most exciting hack-a-Shaq game ever.	M
Duncan tried to foul DeAndre, ref ignored it, Clips hit a 3, Pop went nuts and got a T during the timeout. #joeycrawfordwashere	M
Can't wait to see what Doc does with his bench these next 6 mins. Don't think CP and Blake can play whole 2nd half, too grueling of a game.	M
This feels like a Finals game both in intensity and quality. Crazy amounts of urgency on both sides for a Game 2. The Champs showed up.	M
